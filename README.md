**Note that for the snippets conversion among editors, two spaces are considered as default for tab. However you can tweak a little bit by choose how many spaces exist before the first line of body.**

**Please note that the above statements only apply to snippets conversion, not generation. The generation part relies on the following code convention**



## generate snippets for vscode (vsc), sublime text and atom with the following format

```
# description1
trigger1
body1
# description2
trigger2
body2
etc...
```
## converts snippets from vscode to sublime or to atom, from sublime to vscode or atom, from atom to vscode or sublime.
